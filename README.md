I am glad to share my project which i was done inn a GDSC hackathon conducted by google and our visionary about this project is to collect unwanted garbage fromm the villages 
or cities and to protect our environment. In this project we the user has to give the location of the garbage and he/she can raise the complaint through a text message and
with the help of an image through this the municipal authorities can know the complaint and an image placed by the user and he can check whether it is correct or not
by using location. The admin can ping the location and he can solve the raised complaint.
